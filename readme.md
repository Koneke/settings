# LONG STORY SHORT, FUTURE ME
Just clone this shit straight into your home dir. Since this is cleverly named vimfiles it'll be picked up straight away as your vimdir, and it contains your vimrc. Also your conemu settings, not that they have anything to do with vim (in fact, this was just a general settings repo before), but it was more convenient that way (also this has to be named vimfiles for hacks).

hi this is kind of future me, but for even more future me, something something git-submodule something something to get the git repos of the plugins (i.e. most of them) to follow along nicely. The standard git subrepo or wtf ever that's called doesn't work all that well. Just google git-submodule.
